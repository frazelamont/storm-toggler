#Toggler

Progressive enhancement-lead, accessible toggling. 

- Toggle documentElement class based on target, style agnostic so you can apply your own styles and transitions for the most performant solution
- Uses id/href-based targeting, so falls back to in-document anchor link
- Adds and toggles ARIA attributes
- Built-in transition delays and animating-out class to hook transitions on to avoid unwanted animations on load/resize
- Configurable
- Based on standard HTML5 markup
